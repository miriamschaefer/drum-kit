## Drum kit 🥁

Exercise part of the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

Used this exercise to keep on practicing my Javascript skills. In this particular exercise, the main goal is to practice the key events and transitions. I just added the click event, so users can also play the sounds with their mouse.

- Javascript Vanilla.
- CSS3
